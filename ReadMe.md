## Abstract

Many of the data visualizations for the coronavirus pandemic focus on the number of confirmed cases and deaths. There are not many visualizations that focus on the spread of the pandemic, especially in relation to country health systems. We thought it would be interesting to see whether there is any relation to how ‘good’ a country’s health system is and the spread of the virus in the country. Does the GDP expenditure of a country correlate to a better response to the pandemic? 

Our visualization tool has shown that there is not much correlation seen between health system factors, such as GDP expenditure, and the spread of the virus within a country. This was a surprising result, we expected there to be a clear correlation between health systems and coronavirus cases. Our research sparks more questions, we are curious as to what hidden factors led us to our results. It would be interesting for future researchers to build off of our discoveries.
